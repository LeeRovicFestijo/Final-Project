Utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, the system facilitates accessible online enrollment, module access, and progress tracking. Learners benefit from self-paced modules, real-time progress monitoring, and personalized support from ALS coordinators. With a focus on overcoming barriers to education, the system aims to provide inclusive and transformative learning experiences for ALS students, leveraging the potential of technology to bridge gaps and enhance educational outcomes.
